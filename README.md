# boot_bomb
I tried to come up with a malicious script that was kinda funny in a dumb nerdy way using basic and/&amp; or/|| sleep/wait to conditionally execute after a single successful attempt (on the first try(probably as a root user)) Also found inspiration from Linux Russian Roulette code snippet.
It should upon console bootup have a 1 in 6 chance of commiting FOSS Suicide. [  ... ...(a dark)-lol ]
